# Updated DQL Queries for AI Agent Memory with Relationship Type Facets

## Updated Schema Overview
The database now includes:
- **Memory** nodes: Store content, timestamps, embeddings, and link to entities
- **Entity** nodes: Store named entities with types, descriptions, embeddings, locations, and relationships
- **relatedTo.type facet**: Describes the type of relationship between entities (e.g., "expressed gratitude to", "discussed on", "member of")

## Current Data Summary
- **Entities**: Caroline, Mel, Melanie and various concepts, events, and places
- **Memories**: Conversation transcripts with timestamps
- **Relationship Types**: Rich semantic relationships like "expressed gratitude to", "member of", "discussed", "advocated for", etc.

## 1. Updated Basic Data Exploration Queries

### Query 1: Get all Memory entries with enhanced entity relationships
```dql
{
  memories(func: type(Memory), first: 10) {
    uid
    content
    timestamp

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Insights from Updated Data**

### **Rich Relationship Types Found**
- **Support & Advocacy**: "expressed gratitude for", "advocates for", "received support from"
- **Membership & Participation**: "member of", "participating in", "involved in"
- **Discussion & Communication**: "discussed", "discussed on", "collaborated on"
- **Goals & Aspirations**: "aspiring to create", "desires to provide", "considering"
- **Activities & Engagement**: "engages in", "prioritizing", "participated in"
- **Temporal & Event**: "event on", "occurred on", "referenced"

### **Entity Network Complexity**
- **Caroline**: 40 relationships (highly connected, active in LGBTQ advocacy)
- **Melanie**: 23 relationships (family-focused, mental health advocate)
- **Mel**: 6 relationships (participates in charitable activities)
- **Rich Conversations**: 25+ memory entries with deep contextual relationships

### **AI Agent Memory Benefits**
1. **Semantic Context**: Relationship types provide meaning to connections
2. **Conversation Understanding**: Memory content linked to typed entity relationships  
3. **Interest Mapping**: Track advocacy, aspirations, activities, and discussions
4. **Support Network Analysis**: Identify who supports whom and how
5. **Temporal Tracking**: Connect events, conversations, and relationship evolution
6. **Community Mapping**: Understand group memberships and advocacy patterns

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps for Implementation**

1. **Query Optimization**: Use relationship type filtering for targeted retrieval
2. **Semantic Search**: Combine content search with relationship type filtering
3. **Context Enrichment**: Use entity relationships to enhance memory understanding
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify support networks, advocacy patterns, and interests
5. **Temporal Analysis**: Track relationship evolution over time through conversations

These updated queries provide the foundation for sophisticated AI agent memory retrieval that understands not just what entities are mentioned, but how they relate to each other semantically.

## âœ… **Tested and Working Query Examples**

      type
      relatedTo @facets(first: 3) {
        name

      }
    }
  }
