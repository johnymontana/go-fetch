- **Vector Search**: Semantic search through memories using embeddings
- **Graph Relationships**: Stores entities and memories with relationships in Dgraph
- **Locomo Benchmark Integration**: Purpose-built ingestion for AI agent memory benchmarking
- **Two MCP Tools**:
  - `save_user_message`: Process and save messages with entity extraction
  - `graph_memory_search`: Vector-based search through stored memories

## Graph Data Model

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Dgraph database instance (local or cloud)
- OpenAI or Anthropic API key

## Dgraph Connection

The project uses standard Dgraph connection strings with `dgraph.open()`:

- **Local**: `dgraph://localhost:9080`
- **With auth**: `dgraph://user:password@localhost:9080`
- **Cloud**: `dgraph://your-instance.cloud:443?sslmode=verify-ca&bearertoken=your-token`

## Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` with your configuration:
   ```env
   DGRAPH_CONNECTION_STRING=dgraph://localhost:9080
   AI_PROVIDER=openai
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
   LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   ```

   For cloud instances, use the full connection string:
   ```env
   DGRAPH_CONNECTION_STRING=dgraph://your-instance.cloud:443?sslmode=verify-ca&bearertoken=your-token
   ```

3. **Start Dgraph** (if running locally):
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest
   ```

```

## Testing the MCP Server

### Using MCP Inspector

The [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) is a debugging tool that allows you to test and interact with your MCP server directly. It provides a web interface to call tools, inspect responses, and debug your server implementation.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Install MCP Inspector**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
   ```

2. **Start Dgraph** (if testing with real database):
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest
   ```

3. **Configure your API keys** in `.env`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key
   # or
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_anthropic_api_key
   ```

#### Running the Inspector

1. **Start the MCP Inspector**:
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
   ```

2. **Configure the connection** in the inspector web interface:
   - **Server Command**: `node`
   - **Server Arguments**: `["dist/index.js"]`
   - **Working Directory**: `/path/to/your/graph-fetch/project`

   Or for development mode:
   - **Server Command**: `npm`
   - **Server Arguments**: `["run", "dev"]`
   - **Working Directory**: `/path/to/your/graph-fetch/project`

3. **Test the tools**:

   **Save User Message Tool**:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "I met John Smith at Google headquarters in Mountain View yesterday to discuss the new AI project."
   }
   ```

   **Graph Memory Search Tool**:
   ```json
   {
     "query": "meetings with Google employees",
     "limit": 5
   }
   ```

#### Expected Behavior

- **save_user_message**: Should extract entities (John Smith, Google, Mountain View, AI project) and save them to Dgraph with relationships
- **graph_memory_search**: Should return semantically similar memories based on vector embeddings

#### Troubleshooting

- **Connection issues**: Ensure the server builds successfully with `npm run build`
- **API errors**: Verify your AI provider API key is correctly set in `.env`
- **Database errors**: Make sure Dgraph is running and accessible on the configured port (`docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest`)
- **Tool errors**: Check the inspector console and server logs for detailed error messages
- **Server startup fails**: The MCP server requires Dgraph to be running to initialize. Start Dgraph before testing the server

### Manual Testing

You can also test the server manually using stdio:

```bash
# Start Dgraph (in separate terminal)
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest

# Build and start the server (in main terminal)
npm run build
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list"}' | node dist/index.js
```

### Quick Testing Workflow

Here's a complete workflow to test the MCP server:

```bash
# 1. Start Dgraph
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest

# 2. In a new terminal, build the project
npm run build

# 3. Start MCP Inspector
npm run inspector

# 4. Open the inspector in your browser (usually http://localhost:3000)
# 5. Configure connection with: node dist/index.js
# 6. Test the tools with sample data
```

## Locomo AI Agent Memory Benchmark

Graph Fetch includes a specialized ingestion script for the **Locomo-10** AI agent memory benchmark dataset. This benchmark contains 10 realistic multi-session conversations designed to test an AI agent's ability to build and maintain long-term memory across interactions.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start Dgraph and MCP server
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest
npm run build && npm start

# 2. Test with small sample
node scripts/ingest-locomo.js --max-conversations 1 --max-sessions 1 --max-messages 5

# 3. Process larger batches
node scripts/ingest-locomo.js --max-conversations 2 --max-sessions 3 --max-messages 10
```

### Dataset Overview

- **10 conversations** between different speaker pairs
- **~190 sessions** total (spanning days/weeks per conversation)
- **~4000+ messages** with rich contextual information
- **Realistic scenarios**: Work stress, relationships, life events, personal growth

The ingestion script processes conversations through the Graph Fetch pipeline to:
- Extract entities (people, places, organizations, events, emotions)
- Build relationships between entities automatically  
- Generate embeddings for semantic search
- Store everything in Dgraph as a connected knowledge graph

### Example Output

```bash
üìã Processing conversation 1: Caroline & Melanie
[SAVE] [1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023] Caroline: Hey Mel! Good to see you!
‚úÖ Saved - Successfully saved message with 3 entities (1 new) and 2 relationships. Memory ID: 0x753d

‚úÖ Ingestion completed!
üìà Total processed: 10 messages from 1 conversations  
‚úÖ Successfully saved: 10 ‚ùå Errors: 0
```

### Use Cases

- **Benchmark AI agent memory systems** against standardized dataset
- **Test graph-based memory retrieval** with complex multi-session contexts
- **Evaluate entity extraction** on realistic conversation data
- **Research long-term memory** patterns in AI agent interactions

### Querying Your Data

After ingestion, explore the generated knowledge graph with powerful DQL queries:
- **Relationship analysis**: Find support networks, advocacy patterns, community connections
- **Entity centrality**: Discover most connected people and concepts
- **Temporal tracking**: Analyze relationship evolution across conversations  
- **Semantic search**: Query by relationship types like "expressed gratitude for", "member of", "advocates for"

## Community Detection & Graph Enrichment

Graph Fetch includes a powerful Python companion service for advanced graph analytics that can discover semantic communities within your memory graph and enrich the data model with dedicated community nodes.

### Label Propagation Community Detection

The service uses **Label Propagation** algorithm to automatically discover communities of related entities in your graph data. This unsupervised approach identifies clusters of entities that are semantically connected, revealing the underlying structure of your AI agent's memory.

**How it works:**
1. **Analyzes entity relationships** in your existing Dgraph memory graph
2. **Discovers semantic communities** using NetworkX label propagation algorithm  
3. **Creates dedicated Community nodes** with type `Community` in Dgraph
4. **Establishes member relationships** connecting each community to its member entities
5. **Enriches queries** enabling community-based memory retrieval and analysis

### Graph Data Model Enrichment

The community detection transforms your flat entity-relationship structure into a rich, hierarchical graph:

**Before**: `Entity ‚Üê‚Üí relatedTo ‚Üê‚Üí Entity`

**After**: `Entity ‚Üê‚Üí relatedTo ‚Üê‚Üí Entity`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Üï  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Community`

Each discovered community becomes a first-class entity with:
- **Semantic groupings**: Related people, concepts, events clustered together
- **Metadata**: Algorithm used, community size, execution timestamp
- **Queryable structure**: Find all members of a community or which communities an entity belongs to

### Running Community Detection

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.11+ with UV package manager
- Existing Dgraph instance with Entity/Memory data

```bash
# Navigate to the graph algorithms service
cd graph-algos

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Configure connection to your Dgraph instance
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your DGRAPH_CONNECTION_STRING

# Run label propagation with community node creation
uv run graph-algos community --algorithm label_propagation --write --create-communities

# Verify communities were created
uv run python verify_communities.py
```

### Example Results

When run on an AI agent memory graph with 134 entities:

```bash
‚úÖ Found 17 community nodes
üìä Community Statistics:
   Total communities: 17
   Total member relationships: 134
   Average community size: 7.9

üìä Example Discovered Communities:
   Community 0: Caroline, Mel, conversation dates (37 members)
   Community 1: Melanie, inspiring stories, creative concepts (11 members) 
   Community 2: Mental health topics, charity events (3 members)
   Community 4: Family relationships, community involvement (35 members)
```

### Advanced Querying with Communities

With community nodes created, you can perform sophisticated graph queries:

```dql
# Find all communities and their members
{
  communities(func: type(Community)) {
    uid name algorithm member_count
    members { uid name type }
  }
}

# Find which communities a person belongs to
{
  caroline(func: eq(name, "Caroline")) {
    name
    ~members { name algorithm community_id }
  }
}

# Search memories by community context
{
  mental_health_community(func: eq(name, "label_propagation_community_2")) {
    name member_count
    members {
      name type
      ~relatedTo {
        dgraph.type
        content  # If linked to Memory nodes
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Use Cases

- **Contextual Memory Retrieval**: Find memories by community themes rather than individual entities
- **Semantic Organization**: Understand how your AI agent naturally groups related information
- **Conversation Analysis**: Identify topic clusters and relationship patterns across sessions
- **Memory Summarization**: Generate community-level summaries and insights
- **Graph Exploration**: Navigate memory graph by semantic communities rather than individual connections
