![fetch data model](img/fetch-schema.png)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Dgraph database instance (local or cloud)
- OpenAI or Anthropic API key

## Dgraph Connection

The project uses standard Dgraph connection strings with `dgraph.open()`:

- **Local**: `dgraph://localhost:9080`
- **With auth**: `dgraph://user:password@localhost:9080`
- **Cloud**: `dgraph://your-instance.cloud:443?sslmode=verify-ca&bearertoken=your-token`

## Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` with your configuration:
   ```env
   DGRAPH_CONNECTION_STRING=dgraph://localhost:9080
   AI_PROVIDER=openai
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
   LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   ```

   For cloud instances, use the full connection string:
   ```env
   DGRAPH_CONNECTION_STRING=dgraph://your-instance.cloud:443?sslmode=verify-ca&bearertoken=your-token
   ```

3. **Start Dgraph** (if running locally):
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest
   ```

## Development

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Start production server
npm start

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests for CI
npm run test:ci

# Launch MCP Inspector for testing
npm run inspector

# Quick MCP server test
npm run test:mcp
```

## Testing the MCP Server

### Using MCP Inspector

The [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) is a debugging tool that allows you to test and interact with your MCP server directly. It provides a web interface to call tools, inspect responses, and debug your server implementation.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Install MCP Inspector**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
   ```

2. **Start Dgraph** (if testing with real database):
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest
   ```

3. **Configure your API keys** in `.env`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key
   # or
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_anthropic_api_key
   ```

#### Running the Inspector

1. **Start the MCP Inspector**:
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
   ```

2. **Configure the connection** in the inspector web interface:
   - **Server Command**: `node`
   - **Server Arguments**: `["dist/index.js"]`
   - **Working Directory**: `/path/to/your/graph-fetch/project`

   Or for development mode:
   - **Server Command**: `npm`
   - **Server Arguments**: `["run", "dev"]`
   - **Working Directory**: `/path/to/your/graph-fetch/project`

3. **Test the tools**:

   **Save User Message Tool**:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "I met John Smith at Google headquarters in Mountain View yesterday to discuss the new AI project."
   }
   ```

   **Graph Memory Search Tool**:
   ```json
   {
     "query": "meetings with Google employees",
     "limit": 5
   }
   ```

#### Expected Behavior

- **save_user_message**: Should extract entities (John Smith, Google, Mountain View, AI project) and save them to Dgraph with relationships
- **graph_memory_search**: Should return semantically similar memories based on vector embeddings

#### Troubleshooting

- **Connection issues**: Ensure the server builds successfully with `npm run build`
- **API errors**: Verify your AI provider API key is correctly set in `.env`
- **Database errors**: Make sure Dgraph is running and accessible on the configured port (`docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest`)
- **Tool errors**: Check the inspector console and server logs for detailed error messages
- **Server startup fails**: The MCP server requires Dgraph to be running to initialize. Start Dgraph before testing the server

### Manual Testing

You can also test the server manually using stdio:

```bash
# Start Dgraph (in separate terminal)
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest

# Build and start the server (in main terminal)
npm run build
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list"}' | node dist/index.js
```

### Quick Testing Workflow

Here's a complete workflow to test the MCP server:

```bash
# 1. Start Dgraph
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest

# 2. In a new terminal, build the project
npm run build

# 3. Start MCP Inspector
npm run inspector

# 4. Open the inspector in your browser (usually http://localhost:3000)
# 5. Configure connection with: node dist/index.js
# 6. Test the tools with sample data
```

## Locomo AI Agent Memory Benchmark

Graph Fetch includes a specialized ingestion script for the **Locomo-10** AI agent memory benchmark dataset. This benchmark contains 10 realistic multi-session conversations designed to test an AI agent's ability to build and maintain long-term memory across interactions.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start Dgraph and MCP server
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 dgraph/standalone:latest
npm run build && npm start

# 2. Test with small sample
node scripts/ingest-locomo.js --max-conversations 1 --max-sessions 1 --max-messages 5

# 3. Process larger batches
node scripts/ingest-locomo.js --max-conversations 2 --max-sessions 3 --max-messages 10
```

### Dataset Overview

- **10 conversations** between different speaker pairs
- **~190 sessions** total (spanning days/weeks per conversation)
- **~4000+ messages** with rich contextual information
- **Realistic scenarios**: Work stress, relationships, life events, personal growth

The ingestion script processes conversations through the Graph Fetch pipeline to:
- Extract entities (people, places, organizations, events, emotions)
- Build relationships between entities automatically  
- Generate embeddings for semantic search
- Store everything in Dgraph as a connected knowledge graph

### Example Output

```bash
üìã Processing conversation 1: Caroline & Melanie
[SAVE] [1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023] Caroline: Hey Mel! Good to see you!
‚úÖ Saved - Successfully saved message with 3 entities (1 new) and 2 relationships. Memory ID: 0x753d

‚úÖ Ingestion completed!
üìà Total processed: 10 messages from 1 conversations  
‚úÖ Successfully saved: 10 ‚ùå Errors: 0
```

### Use Cases

- **Benchmark AI agent memory systems** against standardized dataset
- **Test graph-based memory retrieval** with complex multi-session contexts
- **Evaluate entity extraction** on realistic conversation data
- **Research long-term memory** patterns in AI agent interactions

### Querying Your Data

After ingestion, explore the generated knowledge graph with powerful DQL queries:
- **Relationship analysis**: Find support networks, advocacy patterns, community connections
- **Entity centrality**: Discover most connected people and concepts
- **Temporal tracking**: Analyze relationship evolution across conversations  
- **Semantic search**: Query by relationship types like "expressed gratitude for", "member of", "advocates for"

## Community Detection & Graph Enrichment

Graph Fetch includes a powerful Python companion service for advanced graph analytics that can discover semantic communities within your memory graph and enrich the data model with dedicated community nodes.

### Label Propagation Community Detection

The service uses **Label Propagation** algorithm to automatically discover communities of related entities in your graph data. This unsupervised approach identifies clusters of entities that are semantically connected, revealing the underlying structure of your AI agent's memory.

**How it works:**
1. **Analyzes entity relationships** in your existing Dgraph memory graph
2. **Discovers semantic communities** using NetworkX label propagation algorithm  
3. **Creates dedicated Community nodes** with type `Community` in Dgraph
4. **Establishes member relationships** connecting each community to its member entities
5. **Enriches queries** enabling community-based memory retrieval and analysis

### Graph Data Model Enrichment

The community detection transforms your flat entity-relationship structure into a rich, hierarchical graph:

**Before**: `Entity ‚Üê‚Üí relatedTo ‚Üê‚Üí Entity`

**After**: `Entity ‚Üê‚Üí relatedTo ‚Üê‚Üí Entity`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Üï  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Community`

Each discovered community becomes a first-class entity with:
- **Semantic groupings**: Related people, concepts, events clustered together
- **Metadata**: Algorithm used, community size, execution timestamp
- **Queryable structure**: Find all members of a community or which communities an entity belongs to

### Running Community Detection

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.11+ with UV package manager
- Existing Dgraph instance with Entity/Memory data

```bash
# Navigate to the graph algorithms service
cd graph-algos

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Configure connection to your Dgraph instance
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your DGRAPH_CONNECTION_STRING

# Run label propagation with community node creation
uv run graph-algos community --algorithm label_propagation --write --create-communities

# Verify communities were created
uv run python verify_communities.py
```

### Example Results

When run on an AI agent memory graph with 134 entities:

```bash
‚úÖ Found 17 community nodes
üìä Community Statistics:
   Total communities: 17
   Total member relationships: 134
   Average community size: 7.9

üìä Example Discovered Communities:
   Community 0: Caroline, Mel, conversation dates (37 members)
   Community 1: Melanie, inspiring stories, creative concepts (11 members) 
   Community 2: Mental health topics, charity events (3 members)
   Community 4: Family relationships, community involvement (35 members)
```

### Advanced Querying with Communities

With community nodes created, you can perform sophisticated graph queries:

```dql
# Find all communities and their members
{
  communities(func: type(Community)) {
    uid name algorithm member_count
    members { uid name type }
  }
}

# Find which communities a person belongs to
{
  caroline(func: eq(name, "Caroline")) {
    name
    ~members { name algorithm community_id }
  }
}

# Search memories by community context
{
  mental_health_community(func: eq(name, "label_propagation_community_2")) {
    name member_count
    members {
      name type
      ~relatedTo {
        dgraph.type
        content  # If linked to Memory nodes
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Use Cases

- **Contextual Memory Retrieval**: Find memories by community themes rather than individual entities
- **Semantic Organization**: Understand how your AI agent naturally groups related information
- **Conversation Analysis**: Identify topic clusters and relationship patterns across sessions
- **Memory Summarization**: Generate community-level summaries and insights
- **Graph Exploration**: Navigate memory graph by semantic communities rather than individual connections

## Example Agent Memory DQL Queries

Graph Fetch creates a rich knowledge graph that you can explore using Dgraph's DQL (Dgraph Query Language). Here are practical examples of queries to explore your agent memory data, tested and verified with actual results.

### 1. Basic Data Exploration

**Count total entities and memories:**
```dql
{
  entity_count(func: type(Entity)) {
    count(uid)
  }
  
  memory_count(func: type(Memory)) {
    count(uid)
  }
}
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "entity_count": [{"count": 134}],
  "memory_count": [{"count": 85}]
}
```

**Get entity types:**
```dql
{
  entity_types(func: type(Entity)) {
    type
  }
}
```

**Result:** Shows distribution of PERSON, CONCEPT, EVENT, ORGANIZATION, PLACE, and DATE entities across 134 total entities.

### 2. Entity Type Exploration

**Sample PERSON entities:**
```dql
{
  persons(func: type(Entity)) @filter(eq(type, "PERSON")) {
    uid
    name
    type
    description
    createdAt
  }
}
```

    uid
    content
    timestamp
  }
}
```

**Result:** Returns all 85 memories ordered by timestamp, showing conversation flow from May 2023 through February 2023.

### 6. Community and Theme Analysis

**Find community-related entities:**
```dql
{
  community_entities(func: type(Entity)) @filter(eq(name, "community")) {
    uid
    name
    type
    description
    relatedTo {
      uid
      name
      type
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "community_entities": [
    {
      "uid": "0x759e",
      "name": "community",
      "type": "CONCEPT",
      "description": "The idea of a supportive group formed by sharing experiences."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Find support-related entities:**
```dql
{
  support_entities(func: type(Entity)) @filter(eq(name, "support")) {
    uid
    name
    type
    description
  }
}
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "support_entities": [
    {
      "uid": "0x7565",
      "name": "support",
      "type": "CONCEPT",
      "description": "Assistance or backing, particularly in the context of the mentioned stories."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 7. Advanced Pattern Matching

**Find memories containing specific concepts:**
```dql
{
  lgbtq_memories(func: type(Memory)) @filter(anyoftext(content, "LGBTQ")) {
    uid
    content
    entities {
      name
      type
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "lgbtq_memories": [
    {
      "uid": "0x7561",
      "content": "[1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023] Caroline: I went to a LGBTQ support group yesterday and it was so powerful.",
      "entities": [
        {"name": "Caroline", "type": "PERSON"},
        {"name": "8 May, 2023", "type": "EVENT"},
        {"name": "LGBTQ", "type": "CONCEPT"},
        {"name": "support group", "type": "CONCEPT"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "uid": "0x7592",
      "content": "[7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023] Caroline: Hey Melanie! How's it going? I wanted to tell you about my school event last week. It was awesome! I talked about my transgender journey and encouraged students to get involved in the LGBTQ community. It was great to see their reactions. It made me reflect on how far I've come since I started transitioning three years ago.",
      "entities": [
        {"name": "Caroline", "type": "PERSON"},
        {"name": "Melanie", "type": "PERSON"},
        {"name": "LGBTQ community", "type": "CONCEPT"},
        {"name": "my school event", "type": "EVENT"},
        {"name": "transgender journey", "type": "CONCEPT"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The `anyoftext()` function only works on fields with fulltext indexing (like `content`), not on `name` fields.

### 8. Graph Traversal and Path Finding

**Find shortest path between entities:**
```dql
{
  q(func: eq(name, "Caroline")) {
    a as uid
  }
  q1(func: eq(name, "Melanie")) {
    b as uid
  }
  path as shortest(from: uid(a), to: uid(b), numpaths: 5) {
    relatedTo @facets(weight)
  }
  path(func: uid(path)) {
    uid
    name
    type
  }
}
```

**Result:** Returns empty path results, indicating no direct relationship path exists between Caroline and Melanie in the current graph structure.

### 9. Statistical Analysis

**Entity type distribution:**
```dql
{
  type_stats(func: type(Entity)) {
    type
    count(uid)
  }
}
```

**Result:** Returns entity types but count aggregation doesn't work as expected in this version. Use the basic count query instead.

**Memory timeline analysis:**
```dql
{
  memory_timeline(func: type(Memory)) {
    timestamp
    count(uid)
  }
}
```

**Result:** Similar count aggregation issue. Use the basic memory count query for accurate totals.

### 10. Semantic Search and Discovery

**Find related concepts:**
```dql
{
  related_concepts(func: eq(name, "dance")) {
    name
    type
    relatedTo {
      name
      type
      description
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "related_concepts": [
    {
      "name": "dance",
      "type": "CONCEPT"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Discover entity clusters:**
```dql
{
  entity_clusters(func: type(Entity)) {
    name
    type
    relatedTo {
      name
      type
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:** Returns all entities with their relationships, showing the complete knowledge graph structure.

### 11. Geospatial Queries

Graph Fetch includes geospatial data for PLACE entities, enabling location-based queries and analysis. Some places have precise coordinates while others represent conceptual locations.

**Find all places with geographic coordinates:**
```dql
{
  places_with_coords(func: type(Entity)) @filter(eq(type, "PLACE") AND has(location)) {
    uid
    name
    type
    description
    location
  }
}
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "places_with_coords": [
    {
      "uid": "0x75cf",
      "name": "Paris",
      "type": "PLACE",
      "description": "A city in France that Jon visited.",
      "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [2.3522, 48.8566]
      }
    },

      "uid": "0x75d1",
      "name": "Rome",
      "type": "PLACE",
      "description": "Capital city of Italy.",
      "location": {
        "type": "Point",

```dql
{
  all_places(func: type(Entity)) @filter(eq(type, "PLACE")) {
    uid
    name
    type
    description
    location
  }
}
```

**Result:** Returns 7 place entities including:
- **With coordinates**: Paris (France), Rome (Italy)
- **Conceptual places**: downtown, a great spot, homeless shelter, neighborhood, area

**Find places by specific name:**
```dql
{
  paris_info(func: eq(name, "Paris")) {

The geospatial data in Graph Fetch follows the GeoJSON Point format:

```json
{
  "location": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [longitude, latitude]
  }
}
```

**Available coordinates:**
- **Paris, France**: [2.3522, 48.8566] (longitude, latitude)
- **Rome, Italy**: [12.4964, 41.9028] (longitude, latitude)

**Conceptual places** (without coordinates) include:
- downtown, homeless shelter, neighborhood, area, a great spot

### Geospatial Query Capabilities

While the current schema includes geospatial data, advanced spatial queries like:
- `within()` for bounding box searches
- `near()` for radius-based searches
- `distance()` calculations

May require additional geospatial indexing configuration in Dgraph. The current queries focus on:
- **Location data retrieval** for places with coordinates
- **Place-based memory search** using text matching
- **Relationship analysis** between places and other entities
- **Geographic context** for conversation analysis

### Query Tips and Best Practices

1. **Use filters efficiently**: Combine `@filter()` with `func: type()` for better performance
2. **Limit results**: Add `(first: N)` to large queries to avoid overwhelming results
3. **Leverage facets**: Use `@facets()` to get relationship metadata like weights
4. **Combine queries**: Use multiple query blocks to get related information in one request
5. **Index optimization**: Ensure frequently queried fields have appropriate indexes
6. **Text search limitations**: `anyoftext()` only works on fulltext-indexed fields like `content`
7. **Count aggregation**: Some count operations may not work as expected; use basic count queries instead
8. **Geospatial queries**: Use `has(location)` to find entities with coordinates, `eq(name, "PlaceName")` for specific places
9. **Place-based search**: Combine place queries with memory content search for location-aware conversation analysis
10. **Coordinate format**: Geospatial data follows GeoJSON Point format with [longitude, latitude] coordinates

### Example Query Workflow

1. **Start with counts** to understand data volume (use basic count queries)
2. **Explore entity types** to see what's available
3. **Sample specific entities** to understand data quality
4. **Analyze relationships** to discover patterns
5. **Use temporal queries** to understand conversation flow
6. **Apply text search** on content fields for concept discovery
7. **Explore relationship networks** to understand entity connections
8. **Discover geospatial data** by finding places with coordinates
9. **Analyze location context** in conversations and memories
10. **Combine spatial and semantic** data for rich location-aware insights

### Known Limitations

- **Fulltext indexing**: Only available on `content` field, not on `name` field
- **Count aggregation**: Some complex count operations may not work as expected
- **Shortest path**: May return empty results if no direct path exists between entities
- **Text search**: Limited to fields with appropriate indexing
- **Advanced geospatial**: Complex spatial queries like `within()`, `near()`, and `distance()` may require additional indexing
- **Coordinate precision**: Current geospatial data limited to major cities (Paris, Rome) with conceptual places lacking coordinates

These queries demonstrate the power of Graph Fetch's knowledge graph for exploring AI agent memory, understanding conversation patterns, and discovering meaningful relationships between entities. The actual results show rich conversational data with 134 entities and 85 memories spanning multiple conversations and topics.
